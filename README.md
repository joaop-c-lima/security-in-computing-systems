## Caesar Cipher
A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher that receives the key (an integer) and the plain text so that it is encrypted and then analyzed using a letter frequency analysis.

### Letter Frequency Analysis
Encrypted text analysis counts the number of each character from 'a' to 'z' and then stores this count in a list so that, for example, it is assigned to the most frequent character in the cipher, the most frequent character from the list of relative [frequencies of the Portuguese language](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequ%C3%AAncia_de_letras).
